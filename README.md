## Succession in the LDS Church presidency

Probability predictions of becoming president of the LDS Church.

## Background

> In the LDS Church, when a president of the church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, and the members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles rejoin it. The Quorum of the Twelve, which may number greater than twelve with the returning members from the First Presidency, then becomes the presiding council of the church, with the senior apostle as its president. (Seniority is determined by the time since joining the Quorum, not by age.) The President of the Quorum of the Twelve becomes the highest-ranking official in the church and has always become the next church president.[18] However, the appointment is not made official until the Quorum of the Twelve meets and selects the next president of the church.
